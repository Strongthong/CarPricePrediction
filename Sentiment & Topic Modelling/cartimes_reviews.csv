Reviews
I have brought our cars here for many years and their services are excellent. They have a lot of honor and integrity and won't charge overcharge you. They also have another branch in Kaki Bukit. I have been to both. Will continue using their services for many years to come.
"Was served by Tony and he was very attentive to the details and issues the car was facing. Price might be a little steep, so do negotiate for a better deal. Other than that, the workmanship of repairs is well done."
