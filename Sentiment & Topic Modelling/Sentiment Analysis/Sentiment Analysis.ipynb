Love the 7 seater as can bring more along our outing! Love the reward for helping to refuel the car petrol too!   \n",
       "185                                              Getgo has always been part of my daily life. It is super convenient. The help service is very efficient and super responsive. They have been always helping to clear my doubts and queries. Thank you for being the best car-sharing service in Singapore!   \n",
       "120   I have had a great experience with Getgo. There is generally always a car nearby for me to use when I need it and it's ideal for errands around the neighbourhood. The pricing is better that taking a cab two ways and I love the flexibility it gives me. Would definitely recommend trying it out.   \n",

The best part is the experience of driving different models of cars. The support staff are great at their work and always ready to lend a helping hand.   \n",
       "548  Have been using Get Go Car for more than a year and amazing experience so far. The customer care is very impressive with swift responses on booking cancellation requests or any other queries. Big kudos to entire Get Go team and I clearly see the big difference from Other car sharing companies.   \n",

    " For instance, if the majority of reviews are positive, one would expect to see a higher concentration of positive sentiment scores. Similarly, if there are many negative reviews, lower sentiment scores would be expected. This alignment between the sentiment of the reviews and the sentiment scores suggests that the scoring system effectively captures the sentiment expressed in the text.\n",
    "\n",
    " Furthermore, through visual examination of the sentiment score distribution, one can observe whether the sentiment scores cluster around certain values or if there are distinct peaks corresponding to positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. If the distribution follows the expected pattern based on the sentiment of the reviews, it provides additional evidence that the scoring accurately reflects the sentiment conveyed in the text.\n",
